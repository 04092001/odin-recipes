    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is Mary's classic lasagne recipe which has been perfected over the
      years. For the best results leave the lasagne to stand for six hours
      before cooking.

        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <li>Preheat the oven to160C/140C Fan/Gas 3.</li>
        <li>
          For the ragu, heat a large frying pan until hot and add the oil. Cook
          the mince until browned all over. Remove from the heat and transfer to
          a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the onion, celery (if using) and garlic to the pan and cook until
          softened. Return the meat to the pan and stir in the flour. Add the
          stock and bring to the boil. Add the redcurrant jelly (or sugar),
          tomato purée and thyme, then stir well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the tinned tomatoes. Bring to the boil again, cover and simmer
          in the oven for 1–½ hours, or until the beef is tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the lasagne, put one third of the meat sauce in the base of a 2.3
          litre/4 pint shallow ovenproof dish. Spoon one third of the white
          sauce on top. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange one layer of
          lasagne sheets on top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon half of the remaining meat sauce on top and then half of the
          white sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Put another layer of lasagne
          sheets on top, then the remaining meat sauce and remaining white
          sauce. Sprinkle over the cheddar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leave for 6 hours before cooking so that the pasta can start to
          soften.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>
        <li>
          Cook in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes – or until golden
          brown on top, bubbling around the edges and the pasta is soft.
        </li>

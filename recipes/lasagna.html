    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is Mary's classic lasagne recipe which has been perfected over the
      years. For the best results leave the lasagne to stand for six hours
      before cooking.

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to160C/140C Fan/Gas 3.</li>
      <li>
        For the ragu, heat a large frying pan until hot and add the oil. Cook
        the mince until browned all over. Remove from the heat and transfer to a
        plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onion, celery (if using) and garlic to the pan and cook until
        softened. Return the meat to the pan and stir in the flour. Add the
        stock and bring to the boil. Add the redcurrant jelly (or sugar), tomato
        purée and thyme, then stir well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the tinned tomatoes. Bring to the boil again, cover and simmer
        in the oven for 1–½ hours, or until the beef is tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the lasagne, put one third of the meat sauce in the base of a 2.3
        litre/4 pint shallow ovenproof dish. Spoon one third of the white sauce
        on top. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange one layer of lasagne sheets
        on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon half of the remaining meat sauce on top and then half of the white
        sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Put another layer of lasagne sheets
        on top, then the remaining meat sauce and remaining white sauce.
        Sprinkle over the cheddar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave for 6 hours before cooking so that the pasta can start to soften.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>
      <li>
        Cook in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes – or until golden
        brown on top, bubbling around the edges and the pasta is soft.
      </li>
    </ol>
